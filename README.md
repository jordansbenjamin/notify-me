# notify-me

notify-me is a Python program that scrapes the UNSW timetable, keeping track of any updates to changes on available class periods.

I created this program to automate the process of having to check the timetable in order to curate the optimal schedule for my Masters program commencing in 2024.

Saves me and anyone who wishes the use the prgram so much time! This is the second time I've solved a real-world problem through a program, completely from scratch. (Another Python program I used to [solve another problem](https://github.com/jordansbenjamin/Kazoot_PyProject))
